Test Cases
Test cases on this website were very hard to apply. The only place I see that this can work is the Data page. This is because it takes in user input. 
If the user does not enter one of the seven continents, it will nit return anything, The program will only proceed if the user types Antarctica, Australia, 
North America, South America, Europe, and Asia.
